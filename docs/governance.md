# Project Governance

From its inception, Starlite was envisaged as a community driven project. We encourage users to become involved with the
project - feel free to open issues, chime in on discussions, review pull requests and of course - contribute code.

The project is led by a group of maintainers. You can see the list of maintainers in the `pyproject.toml` file.
Additionally, substantial contributors are invited to be members of the `starlite-api` organization. Our aim is to
increase the number of maintainers and have at least 5 active maintainers - this will ensure the long term stability and
growth of Starlite in the long run. Contributors who show commitment, contribute great code and show a willingness to
become maintainers will be invited to do so. So really feel free to contribute and propose yourself as a maintainer once
you contribute substantially.
