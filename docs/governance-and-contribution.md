# Project Governance and Contributions

From its inception, Starlite was envisaged as a community driven project. We encourage users to become involved with the
project - feel free to open issues, chime in on discussions, review pull requests and of course - contribute code.

## Governance

The project is led by a group of maintainers. You can see the list of maintainers in the `pyproject.toml` file.
Additionally, substantial contributors are invited to be members of the `starlite-api` organization. Our aim is to
increase the number of maintainers and have at least 5 active maintainers - this will ensure the long term stability and
growth of Starlite in the long run. Contributors who show commitment, contribute great code and show a willingness to
become maintainers will be invited to do so. So really feel free to contribute and propose yourself as a maintainer once
you contribute substantially.

## Contributing

As stated above, not only code is considered a contribution - any and all assistance and involvement is welcome. Still,
this being a coding project fundamentally, coding contributions are integral. The easiest way to begin contributing is
to checkout the open issues - and reach out on our discord server or Matrix space. Please make sure to consult the `CONTRIBUTING.md`
file at the project's repository root for concerte instructions on how to setup a development environment and how to
submit a pull request.
