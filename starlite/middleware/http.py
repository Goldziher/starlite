        Notes:
             - In order to provide the "expressJS" like interface of the dispatch function, this middleware does some rather
              complex work. While the user is not exposed to this, this creates certain limitations:
                1. this middleware is incompatible with contextvars.
                2. background tasks will not be executed on the response for any handler function for which this
                    middleware is defined.
                3. this middleware does impact performance.
